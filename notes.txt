TODO:
Build models from schemas
Support for 'empty' groups:
    Create functions for 'emptying' groups (empty grp = dummy object). Resolves issue w/ TF getting 'stuck'.
Maybe use association resources instead? Like Azure

Build out support for monitor endpoints
    Can use for tests eg. default route exists, bgp peering up

Checking objects exist / handling exists or not exists more gracefully

Checking on delete if object is referenced and handle gracefully (maybe option to remove references)

Support for multiple versions of FortiOS
    Don't fail on global call on client setup (allows provider to use resources not spun up yet)

Rebuild client
    user/pass auth
    backoffs
